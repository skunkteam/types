## Branded type

Create a Branded type with a given `BrandName`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Branded<T, BrandName extends string> = T extends WithBrands<infer Base, infer ExistingBrands>
    ? WithBrands<Base, BrandName | ExistingBrands>
    : WithBrands<T, BrandName>;
```

<b>References:</b> [WithBrands](./types.withbrands.md)

## Remarks

In order for TypeScript to consider a type separate from another type, we need to brand it. When a type is branded TypeScript will manage correct assignability during TypeScript-compilation, e.g. `int` is assignable to `number`<!-- -->, but `number` is not assignable to `int`<!-- -->.
