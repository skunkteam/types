## Properties type

The properties of an object type.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Properties = Record<string, Type<any>>;
```

**References:** [Type](./types.type.md)

## Remarks

This is a mapping from string-keys to type-validators. During compilation this object is automatically converted into a proper TypeScript type for static analysis by the compiler.
