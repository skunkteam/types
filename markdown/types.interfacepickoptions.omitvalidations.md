## InterfacePickOptions.omitValidations property

Suppress the error about existing custom validations on the base type.

**Signature:**

```typescript
omitValidations?: true;
```

## Remarks

Validations are not reused when picking or omitting properties from a base type. This is because validations work on the original base type. The new type, with some properties omitted, is not assignable to the original type. Therefore, we cannot reliably call the validations with instances of the new type.

When a custom validation is encountered by Skunk Team types, an Error will be thrown. Use this option to ignore the validations and continue with the pick or omit operation.

This is to ensure that custom validations are never accidentally lost.
