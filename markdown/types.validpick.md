## validPick variable

Check if the intersection of all the non-empty narrowed keys is not empty. If it is, it means the picked keys describe an impossible union variant. Empty narrowed keys are ignored, because they will not end up in the union at all.

**Signature:**

```typescript
validPick: (pickedKeys: string[], innerTypeKeys: OneOrMore<string[]>) => boolean;
```
