## InterfaceMergeOptions.ignoreValidations property

Suppress the error about existing custom validations on one of the types that is being merged.

**Signature:**

```typescript
ignoreValidations?: true;
```

## Remarks

Validations are reused when merging multiple interface types using [withOptional](./types.interfacetype.withoptional.md)<!-- -->, [withRequired](./types.interfacetype.withrequired.md) and [mergeWith](./types.interfacetype.mergewith.md)<!-- -->. But only when no properties overlap between the types that are being merged. As long as the properties don't overlap we can be sure that the merged type is assignable to each of the original types (`A & B` is assignable to both `A` and `B`<!-- -->). Therefore, the validations are still safe to run, even though the type has been extended with additional properties.

However, when overlap is detected in the property-names of the types and any custom validation is encountered by Skunk Team types, an Error will be thrown. Use this option to ignore the custom validations and continue with the merge. Beware that all custom validations are then NOT applied to the resulting type.
